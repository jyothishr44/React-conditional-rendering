# React Conditional Rendering âš¡

This project demonstrates how to conditionally render components in React using different approaches like `if-else`, logical `&&`, and the ternary (`? :`) operator.

## ðŸš€ What I Learned
- How to render components based on conditions
- Using `if-else` statements for conditional rendering
- Using ternary operator (`condition ? A : B`) for inline rendering

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `ConditionalComponent.jsx` â€“ main component demonstrating conditional rendering
- `App.jsx` â€“ renders the conditional component
- `index.html` â€“ base HTML file

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered
- Conditional rendering patterns in React
- Rendering dynamic UI elements based on user actions

ðŸ’¡ *This project helped me understand how React updates the UI dynamically based on changing conditions â€” a core concept for interactive apps!*
